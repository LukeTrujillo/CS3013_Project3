Notes:

1. generate threads and make a lock that prevents threads from starting
2. unlock and begin process (start sleep timer for arrival times)


announce when someone has arrived. make a queue?


who to let in side
numOfCostumeTeams


if a arrival is close to 30 mins
  then do that immediately, if they have the same then its random
 else 
  favor the side with a number of people waiting with equal to numOfCostumeTeams
  
  if both sides have > numOfCostume Teams
    take the average arrival time and go with the highest one
    
    if the same then random
*arrived pirates and ninjas are stored in a ordered queue where the head of the queue is stored by their time of arrival (older threads go first)
